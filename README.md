# Iris Train — Classification Model Project
This project focuses on building a complete machine learning pipeline for the Iris dataset, one of the most well-known datasets in pattern recognition. The goal is to train, evaluate, and understand classification models that can accurately predict the species of iris flowers based on features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The project includes data loading, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, performance evaluation, and result visualization. It is designed to help learners and practitioners understand how classical machine learning workflows are structured and how different algorithms perform on a simple, balanced dataset.
It also serves as a foundation for experimenting with new models, fine-tuning hyperparameters, and exploring concepts like accuracy, confusion matrices, and model comparison.

This repository is suitable for students, beginners, and anyone looking to strengthen their grasp of supervised learning through a clean and organized project structure.
